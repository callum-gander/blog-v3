Maliant is my first major project. It's inspired by apps like Migaku and aims to provide a comprehensive and powerful set of tools to allow anyone to easily immerse and practice language learning.

It's currently in the final stage of development with plans to be released in the second half of 2025. If you're interested, please sign up at [here](https://maliant.io) to get notified when it's released
